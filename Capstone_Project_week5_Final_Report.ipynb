    "More and more small/medium farmers (or even newcomers in the farming business) are deciding to grow organic food and target “conscious” customers.\n",
    "<br>However they may face various difficulties and especially:\n",
    "<br> - Despite the topical trend for organic food, it is hard to target and then deliver the products to the right customers that are willing to pay more for this kind of food.\n",
    "<br> - Retailers (both large and organic food specialized) do exist and are representing the majority of the market, but business relations may be complicated due to their negotiation power and the quantities requested to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Marketplaces can be the solution for small/medium farmers.__\n",
    "<br> - These places have indeed different interesting characteristics:\n",
    "<br> - They are generally in public areas within cities where traders/farmers can directly display and sell their products to the customers during a short period of time (few hours one or few times a week)\n",
    "<br> - They are supposed to be cheap for sellers (who need to pay a fee to the public/private organizer to rent a spot)\n",
    "<br> - Most marketplaces are food related but there are dedicated marketplaces for other products such as clothes, books or even birds\n",
    "<br> - They offer a nice visibility\n",
    "<br> - They are friendly places and part of the French tradition\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Thereby, marketplaces for food are a very efficient channel for small/medium farmers to promote their farm and production processes, and sell their products “hand over hand”.__\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are 94 marketplaces dispersed all over the inner Paris (the first 20 districts only without taking into account the suburbs or “banlieue”): this represents a lot of data and it is complicated for a “new-comer” to have many insights on the different features of the marketplaces and more importantly of their surroundings (district, most common venues…). In fact we want here to target “conscious” customers who are willing to pay for organic products. "

    "**The plan falls into 8 parts:**\n",
    "1. Introduction (Note + Importation of the needed librairies)\n",
    "2. Data Preparation\n",
    "3. Geographical representation of the data (marketplaces)\n",
    "4. Foursquare Credentials and Version\n",
    "5. Data exploration\n",
    "6. Data (Marketplaces) analysis\n",
    "7. Cluster of the marketplaces in Paris (5 clusters)\n",
    "8. Clusters examination\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction (Note + Importation of the needed librairies)**\n",
    "We start by noting that several parts of the code provided have been reused from the Coursera IBM Datascience professional certificate.\n",
    "<br>We then import the needed Python libraries (mainly Pandas, Numpy, json, matplotlib, sklearn and folium).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation**\n",
    "During this stage we will manipulate (or pre-process) raw data from a dataset representing all of the marketplaces in the inner Paris and its suburbs downloaded at opendata.paris.fr.\n",
    "<br>The main operations are: translation of the key labels, addition of relevant columns/information, restriction of the city districts to the inner Paris only (first 20 city districts), restriction of food related-marketplaces, and type conversions to the right ones.\n",
    "<br>This preliminary step is needed in our analysis so that we have accurate data presented in a way that we can carry out the further steps presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographical representation of the data (marketplaces)**\n",
    "We here use the Folium library to locate on a map all of the 83 marketplaces dedicated to food. It gives a first overview of their location and dispersion. \n",
    "<br>It also allows to check wether our final dataset is consistent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foursquare Credentials and Version**\n",
    "This step is required to register our credentials and version to authenticate and then leverage the Foursquare API. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data exploration**\n",
    "We set at 10 the limit of number of venues returned by Foursquare API in order for the program to execute properly. As the inner center of Paris is both a small and a very dense area we limit the radius at 500 meters around the marketplaces.\n",
    "<br>We use the Explore Feature of the Foursquare API to find the most popular venues. It is the best way to get really interresting insights on the different features of the marketplaces and more importantly of their surroundings. It is a great feature of Foursquare to identify what is special, trending, what spots are recommended, etc...\n",
    "<br>We then get a new dataset (paris_venues) that returns the top venue (e.g. \"Café Pouchkine\") and its Venue Category (e.g. \"Dessert Shop\"). For the huge majority of the marketplaces we get 10 venues as requested: this shows that we will be able to carry out a consistent analysis with enough data. We also note that there are 147 uniques categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data (Marketplaces) analysis**\n",
    "We try here to analyze each marketplace. In that regard, we create a new dataframe with dummy variables corresponding to the venues categories. This will allow us in a second dataframe to group rows by marketplace and by taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category. We end up with a dataframe with 81 rows and 148 columns.\n",
    "<br>We then print each marketplace along with the top 5 most common venues: this gives us a report by marketplace displaying the top venues categories and their frequencies.\n",
    "<br>For better data description/visualization, we finally create a last dataframe (Marketplace_venues_sorted) that displays the top 10 venues in columns by marketplace in rows.\n",
    "<br>The conclusion of this part is that the results are hard to analyze. Indeed, most of the venues categories are related to food (e.g. \"French Restaurant\", \"Italian Restaurant\", \"Japanese Restaurant\"...) or tourist activites (e.g. \"Park\", \"Cultural Center\",...).\n",
    "<br>Yet, we can notice the presence of interesting venue categories for a potential business decision such as: \"Farmers Market\" or \"Vegetarian / Vegan Restaurant\".\n",
    "<br>For a better understanding of the results, we will need to cluster the marketplaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster of the marketplaces in Paris (5 clusters)**\n",
    "To cluster the marketplaces based on their top 10 venues categories, we will use the K-means machine learning algorythm.\n",
    "<br>Using the sklearn library, we run k-means to cluster the marketplaces into 5 clusters.\n",
    "<br>Finally, we use again the Folium library to locate on a map all of the 83 marketplaces dedicated to food and their emerging cluster. \n",

    "<br>**The map of the marketplaces dedicated to food only** for the first 20 city districts (the inner center of Paris). Thus we can make some observations that may be interpreted differently by the sellers but that need to be pointed out:\n",

    "<br>- some marketplaces are far from the centre\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>**5 clusters** presenting various venues categories that give some precious insight on the customer population and so we hope their potential to come to the marketplace and buy organic food:\n",
    "<br>- **cluster 1:** we can call this custer **\"Various foods and drinks\"**. This cluster of 14 marketplaces presents a variety of results for the most part around food & drinks but without much consistency at first sight (e.g. \"Bistro\", \"Restaurant\", \"Wine Bar\"...)\n",
    "<br>- **cluster 2:** we can call this cluster **\"Shopping and other tourist activities\"**. Indeed and contrary to the cluster 1, we have much less categories related to food but mostly around shoping and tourist activities such as \"Plaza\", \"Stadium\", \"Historic Site\", \"Art Gallery\"... This cluster is composed of 21 markeplaces.\n",
    "<br>- **cluster 3:** we can call this cluster **\"Worldwide restauration\"** as it is composed mostly of categories around food with many different labels such as \"Argentinian Restaurant\", \"Creperie\", \"Chinese Restaurant\"... There is no real predominance of French food categories within it. This cluster is composed of 23 marketplaces.\n",
    "<br>- **cluster 4:** as opposed to cluster 3, we can call this cluster **\"French restauration\"** as the first category is always \"French Restaurant\". It is also interesting to note that we find the following categories: \"Bakery\", \"Gourmet Shop\", \"Seafood Restaurant\", and \"Farmers Market\". This cluster is composed of 17 marketplaces.\n",
    "<br>- **cluster 5:** we can call this cluster **\"Vegetarian / Vegan\"** as we find the \"Vegetarian / Vegan Restaurant\" category in it. Yet, it is quite hard to observe much consistency in it as various other categories labels are present such as \"Bookstore\", \"Gym center\" or \"Gift Shop\". This cluster is composed of 8 marketplaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result we would recommend a farmer **to focus on customers promoting local / french  + vegetarian / vegan food.** \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Thereby we consider the **clusters 4 and 5** as the most promising.\n",
    "<br>So, this is not a coincidence if 4 out of the 8 marketplaces of the cluster 5 are located in the 16th citydistrict that is more residential.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Within these 2 clusters, we would particulary recommend the following marketplaces:\n",
    "<br>-**Batignolles (cluster 4)** where French restauration + Farmers Market come out. \n",
    "<br>-**Popincourt and Bastille (cluster 5)** where French restauration as Vegetarian / Vegan Restaurant are poping. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Of course, any seller can and should use the detailed results and categories to make his mind up."
